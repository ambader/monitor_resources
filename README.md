# monitor_resources
Python threat that creates a dict/plot of observations while another code runs

The [monitor_resources.py](https://github.com/ambader/monitor_resources/blob/main/monitor_resources.py) file contains a class that allows to extract and store changing variables during any python code execution. It also provides a pandas table with the result and plots it.
